Project Raijin, with its original title “Collaborative Research: EarthCube Capabilities: Raijin: Community Geoscience Analysis Tools for Unstructured Mesh Data”, has been awarded by NSF 21-515 EarthCube for an award period of 1 September, 2021 - 31 August, 2024.

The Raijin administration team is a consortium between NSF NCAR and Pennsylvania State University. The GeoCAT team will be responsible for the development of the Python visualization and analysis functions. While doing so, GeoCAT will ensure that an open development environment is established, the implementation work is well documented, and the deployments are well aligned with the project milestones as well as Scientific Python Ecosystem requirements and specifications.

The goal of this three-year NSF Earth Cube funded effort is to
develop open source, Python based tools for the analysis of simulation
data sampled on unstructured grids. Next generation models of the
earth’s climate and global weather will employ unstructured meshes
to enable greater scalability and unprecedented higher resolutions
needed for more realistic and accurate modeling of the earth system.
