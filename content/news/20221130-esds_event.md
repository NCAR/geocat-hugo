NCAR's [Earth System Data Science (ESDS)](https://ncar.github.io/esds/) 
hosted A (Re)Introduction to Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Across 
NCAR/UCAR/UCP on November 10th and 11th. This event has been a great 
implementation of hybrid tutorials, discussion forums, and hackathons 
in NCARâ€™s Mesa Lab Main Seminar Room and over Google Meet. 

GeoCAT tutorials and a demonstration of VAPOR's new Python API 
took place in the event as well.

Please have a look at the [ESDS 
post](https://ncar.github.io/esds/posts/2022/esds-event-recap/), which 
recaps the event, for further details. As you can see from that post,
the recordings from the plenary sessions can be found here: [Day
