NCAR's [Earth System Data Science (ESDS)](https://ncar.github.io/esds/) 
hosted a (Re)Introduction to Earth System Data Science (ESDS) Across 
NCAR/UCAR/UCP on November 10th and 11th. This event was a successful 
implementation of hybrid tutorials, discussion forums, and hackathons 
in NCARâ€™s Mesa Lab Main Seminar Room and over Google Meet. 

GeoCAt tutorials and a demonstration of VAPOR's new Python API 
took place in the event as well.

Please have a look at the [ESDS post](TODO: Add URL) that recaps the 
event to access the video recordings and other details!
