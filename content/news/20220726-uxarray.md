[Project Raijin](https://vast.ucar.edu/projects/raijin/) realizes 
the unstructured grids data recognition and analysis through our 
recently created, open-source, Python-based package, 
[UXarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray). 

We are thrilled to 
announce that UXarray has made its official debut in June, 2022 via 
[Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/uxarray) and 
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uxarray/) releases. So far, it has 
had June and July versions, and is planned to be released monthly. 

UXarray, with its current versions, makes it possible to read in 
unstructured meshes in UGRID, SCRIP, and Exodus formats, as well as 
to execute analysis operators such as calculating individual/total 
face areas and integrating over all the faces of the mesh. It can 
even help visualize unstructured meshes if combined with a Python 
visualization tool, as can be seen in the images of this blog post 
that are created through our SIParCS 2022 internship by Philip 
Chmielowiec.
