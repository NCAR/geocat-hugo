The [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team has launched the GeoCAT 
tutorials to provide its community with guided teaching as well as 
self-taught content.

The tutorial materials can be accessed via its [GitHub 
repository](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-tutorials); cloning and 
setting up a local configuration as described in the repository home, 
or through its [Binder 
environment](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/geocat-tutorials/main) 
right away online! 

The content can be viewed at its statically generated [documentation 
page](https://geocat-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as well. The 
readers of this documentation page can also access to the past tutorial 
versions.
