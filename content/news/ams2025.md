Data visualization is a crucial component of the scientific process. With the growing complexity of Earth System science data, it is crucial to stay abreast of the latest advancements in tools and techniques. This half day short course guides participants through a range of tools, techniques, and resources (e.g. Project Pythia, GeoCAT) for visualization of Earth System science data across scales leveraging open-source software from the scientific Python ecosystem (e.g. Matplotlib, Cartopy, Holoviews, Geoviews, UXarray).

The course covers advanced techniques, including domain-specific plots, animations, interactive tools, and visualization of data on unstructured grids.
