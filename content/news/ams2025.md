Data visualization is a crucial component of the scientific process. With the growing complexity of Earth System science data, it is crucial to stay abreast of the latest advancements in tools and techniques for Python scientific visualization. This half day “short course” at the 105th annual AMS meeting will introduce participants to open-source tools and resources (GeoCAT and Project Pythia) and demonstrate several cutting edge plotting libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Cartopy, Holoviews). 

The course covers advanced techniques, including domain-specific plots, animations, interactive tools, and visualization of data on unstructured grids, to address typical challenges in Earth System science.
