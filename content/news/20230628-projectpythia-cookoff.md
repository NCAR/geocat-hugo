One year from when [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) first introduced
[Cookbooks](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org/), NCAR hosted Project Pythia's first
["Cookbook Cook-Off"](https://projectpythia.org/pythia-cookoff-2023/README.html)
hackathon.

Pythia Cookbooks provide example end-to-end geoscientific workflows and are an important tool towards
reproducible science efforts.

36 members of the Project Pythia team and larger Pangeo community gathered at NCAR's Mesa Lab in Boulder,
CO and remotely for a hybrid hacakthon June 20-23, 2023 to 
expand content and improve infrastructure support for Cookbook development. 

During the hackthon, significant additions were made to our
[Radar Cookbook](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/radar-cookbook) and infrastructure changes were
made to better support DOI citations of Cookbooks. We are expecting 10 novel Cookbooks to join
our gallery soon.

From our post-hackathon exit survey, everyone enjoyed the event, felt that they learned new skills and that their
contributions were valued. One scientist commented, "The hackathon for me has become a great place to get a sense
of a community. Seeing people enthusiastic about coding up notebooks that would benefit the research community is
a gateway for someone starting to code in Python." This comment mirrors the efforts of Project Pythia as a
community-owned resource.
