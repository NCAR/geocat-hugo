This month long-time VAPOR collaborator and advisor Pablo Mininni,
University of Buenos Aires, published this exciting [article](https://earthenvironmentcommunity.nature.com/posts/a-fiery-dance-of-fire-and-thunder-multiphase-turbulent-flow-explains-lightning-rings-in-volcanic-plumes-97a7d36c-b8c0-4455-9d85-4a8453e3e102) on
volcanic lightning in Nature. Mininni et al used VAPOR to visualize
millions of simulated particles that can collide and generate static
electricity, which may result in intense volcanic lightning. The
recent Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haâ€™apai eruption, upon which this study
is based, generated the highest concentration of volcanic lightning
strikes ever recorded.
