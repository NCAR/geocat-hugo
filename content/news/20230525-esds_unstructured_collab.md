“Working With Unstructured Grids” have been the topic of the first Collaborative Work 
Time event of NCAR's [ESDS](https://ncar.github.io/esds/) on April 17, 2023.

GeoCAT, being part of ESDS and leading the software development efforts for 
[Project Raijin](https://raijin.ucar.edu/), helped organize and facilitate the event, 
thanks to great dedication from GeoCAT team members (namely Anissa Zacharias, Katelyn 
FitzGerald, Orhan Eroglu, Philip Chmielowiec). Furthermore, our 
[UXarray](https://uxarray.readthedocs.io/) development partners, i.e. The Department of 
Energy's SEATS Project members Paul Ulrich (University of California, Davis) and Rajeev 
Jain (Argonne National Laboratory), joined us with this facilitation. 

Participants were asked to self-organize into subgroups for either their own work idea or 
another topic of interest. Raijin and UXarray members facilitated at least three of those 
subgroups, two being solely on UXarray. Event has been a success, giving us the opportunity 
to discuss use cases, get feedback from the community members on UXarray, and even code 
together with our users to resolve some issues we found during the event. The overall 
takeaway was that the event was very fruitful and similar events needed to repeat in the 
future.

For further details about the event, please have a look at the [ESDS recap
