Dear GeoCAT users,

We would like to make an important announcement about our Conda releases of GeoCAT software packages:

The GeoCAT team has moved the Conda releases of several software tools (listed below) from the “NCAR” channel to the “conda-forge” channel only, effective after the v2022.07.* versions. From now on, please be sure to install GeoCAT tools from conda-forge for the latest version. For reproducibility purposes however, the older versions at the NCAR channel will still be accessible.

GeoCAT tools affected by this decision:

 - GeoCAT-comp
 - GeoCAT-f2py
 - GeoCAT-viz
 - GeoCAT-datafiles
