**NEVERWORLD2** is a set of four idealized ocean simulations designed to 
study mesoscale eddies.  These simulations were performed with horizontal 
grid spacings of 1/4째, 1/8째, 1/16째, and 1/32째.

These simulations are driven by a time-scale adjustment that is controlled
by mechanical processes, rather than far slower thermodynamic processes.
This makes it far more affordable to achieve a quasi-equilibrium state in
these high resolution simulations.
