The ViSR team had a strong showing in the Visualization Showcase
at [SC23](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/)  this year, the premier
conference for High Performance Computing. Two entries from ViSR
were accepted into the event, [Visualizing the Impact of the Asian
Summer Monsoon on the Composition of the Upper Troposphere and Lower
Stratosphere](https://youtu.be/556E7MUCFVU), and [Visualizing
Megafires: How AI Can Be Used to Drive Wildfire Simulations with
Better Predictive Skill](https://youtu.be/RGcGFBrTurQ). In addition,
ViSR’s Scott Pearse was on hand to accept the HPCWire Readers'
Choice Award for Best Use of High Performance Data Analytics. The
award text stated that “National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR) scientists developed a machine learning model to update fuel
maps quickly and accurately, providing significant improvements to
wildfire forecasts that could aid in evacuation and fire rescue
efforts”. Way to go team!
