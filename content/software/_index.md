DART has been developed since the early 2000's. There have been nine major
releases of DART, each denoted by the name of an island. The releases began
with the Easter release on April 9, 2004 and continued with Fiji, Guam, Hawaii,
Iceland, Jamaica, Kodiak and Lanai.

The current release of DART is the Manhattan release. It is available for
download via [GitHub](https://github.com/NCAR/DART). All previous releases of
DART are also available by checking out a tagged commit. If you are a new user,
DAReS staff strongly recommend using the Manhattan version. The DART
documentation can be viewed online at
[https://docs.dart.ucar.edu](https://docs.dart.ucar.edu).

DART also provides a framework for developing, testing, and distributing
advances in ensemble DA to a broad community of users by handling the
implementation details common to data assimilation methods.  DART can be used
with external forward operators such as those provided in [NOAA's Gridpoint
Statistical Interpolation](https://docs.dart.ucar.edu/en/latest/observations/obs_converters/GSI2DART/readme.html)  System.
