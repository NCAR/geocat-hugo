UXarray aims to address the geoscience community's need for tools that enable standard data analysis techniques and visualization functionality to operate directly on unstructured grid data (i.e. without regridding to structured grids). 

UXarray provides Xarray-styled functionality to read in and analyze unstructured grid datasets that follow standard conventions, including MPAS, ESMF, GEOS, ICON, etc. model outputs, and UGRID, SCRIP, Exodus, etc. grid formats in a standardized user interface. 

This effort was initialized as a result of the collaboration between NSF's Project Raijin (NSF NCAR and Pennsylvania State University) and DOE's SEATS Project (Argonne National Laboratory, UC Davis, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), and is open to further community engagement.
