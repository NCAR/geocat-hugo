UXarray aims to address the geoscience community's need for tools that enable standard data analysis techniques to operate directly on unstructured grid data. UXarray provides Xarray-styled functionality to better read in and use unstructured grid datasets that follow standard conventions, including UGRID, MPAS, GEOS, ICON, SCRIP, ESMF, and Exodus grid formats. This effort is a result of the collaboration between Project Raijin (NSF NCAR and Pennsylvania State University) and the SEATS Project (Argonne National Laboratory, UC Davis, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory).
