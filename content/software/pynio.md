PyNIO is a Python module used for reading and writing NetCDF, GRIB, HDF, and HDF-EOS.

NCAR has made the decision to adopt Python as the scripting language platform of choice for future development of analysis and visualization tools. As part of this decision, PyNIO is being placed into maintenance mode. Please read this [open letter to NCL users](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/open_letter_to_ncl_users.shtml) to understand what kind of impact this will have on the future of NCL and PyNIO.
