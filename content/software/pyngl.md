PyNGL is a Python language module for generating high-quality 2D visualizations of scientific data. It si built on top of the same "resource" model used in the NCAR Command Language.

NCAR has made the decision to adopt Python as the scripting language platform of choice for future development of analysis and visualization tools. As part of this decision, both NCL and PyNIO are being placed into maintenance mode. Please read this [open letter to NCL users](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/open_letter_to_ncl_users.shtml) to understand what kind of impact this will have on the future of NCL and PyNIO.
